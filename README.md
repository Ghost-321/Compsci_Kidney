This project essentially focuses in mapping the Kidney Vascular Structure in a 2D and 3D structure. This can further be looked into within this Kaggle Competition code developed between me and another student which is as follows:

We have successfully annotated the vascular structure within the kidneys based off CT scans to a accuracy of 81% peak crushing most industry papers in terms of accuracy and success. We've further developed a code model which can produce 
3D images of the Kidneys based on their CT Scans. This 3D modelling is the highlight of our research and if you would like a copy feel free to contact me jonathan.morel9879@gmail.com where I can answer questions or attach a copy of research paper.
