This project essentially focuses in mapping the Kidney Vascular Structure in a 2D and 3D structure. This can further be looked into within this Kaggle Competition code developed between me and another student which is as follows:

We have successfully annotated the vascular structure within the kidneys based off CT scans to a accuracy of 81% peak crushing most industry papers in terms of accuracy and success. We've further developed a code model which can produce 
3D images of the Kidneys based on their CT Scans. This 3D modelling is the highlight of our research and if you would like a copy feel free to contact me jonathan.morel9879@gmail.com where I can answer questions or attach a copy of research paper.

Our Research essentially focuses on informing people on the issues in relation to Kidney Disease and begin research on ways to consider early testing. The general concept is not to replace current testing methods but assist in deciding who should receive these tests earlier as more and more individuals are simply discovering they have Kidney related issues too late and suffer greatly at a cost of this.
